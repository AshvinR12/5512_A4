# Data sources

```{r}
#load case data from the csv
case_data <- read_csv(here::here("data/NCOV_cases_by_postcode_LGA.csv"))
```

```{r}
#filter the data for the investigation period
data <- case_data %>% filter(diagnosis_date >= "2020-06-01",
                             diagnosis_date <= "2020-08-13") 
```

1. The data was sourced from the Victoria Health Coronavirus website, which stores the data of all the coronavirus cases throughout Victoria since 2020. They have data sets available for outsiders to download and analyze, as well as post updated information frequently.

Of the data sets available for download the data chosen for this analysis was Victorian case data that contains 'all data of PCR and RAT cases by Local Government Area and postcode'. This is primarily because this data set contains more variables thereby giving more flexibility and control for the analysis and results. It will help bolster the objective of this analysis and help improve understanding of the results provided.

This data is protected by copyright under a Creative Commons Attribution Version 4.0, which is an international license. Therefore, when using this data we must be mindful of the restrictions laid out in the aforementioned license.

2. This is a observational data as the Victoria Health department specified that they gathered their data through contact tracing and management of the COVID-19 outbreak. This is indicative that researcher or health professionals do not control the factors affecting the variables, meaning that the variables themselves are independent, but rather they attempt to determine correlation of factors. In this scenario the independent variables are the coronavirus cases or people affected by the coronavirus.

4. In this data set the "postcode" can be considered a unique identifier as it can easily identify an individual especially when combined with the diagnosis date and case count.

5. The data set in its current form can be stored and used for analysis of the research question, however there are a few variables that are not essential to the analysis. Therefore, to keep the report concise and accurate we will remove the columns PCR_case_count and RAT_case_count.

```{r}
cleaned_data <- data %>% select(-PCR_case_count,-RAT_case_count)
```
